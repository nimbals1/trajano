License choice
==============

The [Trajano][] organization has chosen [Eclipse Public License][] as the
[license][] of choice for the products that are created.

The primary reason is it is acceptable by OSS guidelines in most enterprises
and is vetted by many commercial vendors including IBM.  Secondly it is a
recognized open source license.  See [FAQ for Eclipse Public License][1] for
further answers.

However, some projects that are derived from other opensource projects will
retain their respective license. e.g. [Twentyfourteen Maven Skin][2] uses GPL.
