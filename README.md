About this project
------------------

This project provides the [Trajano][] organizational POM.  In this project, 
the overall reports and core plug-ins are specified along with branding details.

The organizational POM version numbering scheme is a single numeric number.  
This is similar to the way Apache does their POM versioning.

Services used
-------------

For [issue tracking][], github is used.

The following on-line services are used for [distribution management][].

* github is used as the [source repository][].
	
* [000webhost][] is used to host the project site via [Wagon FTP][].

* [Sonatype OSS][] is used as the repository as it provides a freely available 
  Nexus server and provides [detailed instructions][2]
	
The services above should not be used in a real enterprise as they are public 
and the extensions used are not guaranteed to be developed regularly.  They 
are used only as a means to an end to allow for public publishing.
	
An actual enterprise should be using proper hosting for the services within 
its own walls.
