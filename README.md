### About this project

This project provides the [Trajano][] organizational POM.  In this project, 
the [services used][2], [overall reports][4] and [core plug-ins][3] are 
specified along with branding details.

The organizational POM version numbering scheme is a single numeric number. This
is similar to the way [Apache][] does their POM versioning.
