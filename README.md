Trajano
=======

[Trajano][] is an IT Consulting/Contracting delivery organization specialising
in end-to-end enterprise architecture, systems design and development.  It is 
founded by [Archimedes Trajano][1] [[LinkedIn][]] [[StackOverflow][]].
	
### About this project

This project provides the [Trajano][] organizational POM.  In this project, 
the [services used][2], [overall reports][4] and [core plug-ins][3] are 
specified along with branding details.  In a way this codifies the
[Standards Information Base][2] for the organization.

### Versioning

The organizational POM version numbering scheme is a single numeric number. This
is similar to the way [Apache][] does their POM versioning.  The only exception
is when there is a build issue, but the core plugin versions and configurations
have not changed and it had already been released to central.
